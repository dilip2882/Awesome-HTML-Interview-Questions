3. **How do you create an unordered list in HTML?**  
   An unordered list in HTML is created using the `<ul>` tag. Each list item is defined with the `<li>` tag.
   ```html
   <ul>
     <li>Item 1</li>
     <li>Item 2</li>
     <li>Item 3</li>
   </ul>
   ```

5. **How do you create an ordered list in HTML?**  
   An ordered list in HTML is created using the `<ol>` tag. Each list item within the `<ol>` tag is marked with the `<li>` tag.

   ```html
   <ol>
       <li>First item</li>
       <li>Second item</li>
       <li>Third item</li>
   </ol>
   ```

7. **How do you create a nested list in HTML?**  
   To create a nested list in HTML, you simply place one list inside another list. For example:

   ```html
   <ul>
       <li>Item 1</li>
       <li>Item 2
           <ul>
               <li>Subitem 1</li>
               <li>Subitem 2</li>
           </ul>
       </li>
       <li>Item 3</li>
   </ul>
   ```

10. **What is the default display style for `<ul>` and `<ol>` elements?**  
    The default display style for `<ul>` (unordered list) elements is `list-item` and for `<ol>` (ordered list) elements is also `list-item`.

    [⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)

11. **How do you specify a starting number for an ordered list?**  
    You can specify a starting number for an ordered list using the `start` attribute in the `<ol>` tag, like this: `<ol start="3">`.

24. **How do you create a list with custom bullet points using images?**  
    You can create a list with custom bullet points using images by setting the `list-style-image` property in CSS to the URL of the image you want to use as the bullet point.

    [⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)

25. **How can you create a list with Roman numerals or letters instead of regular numbers?**  
    You can create a list with Roman numerals or letters instead of regular numbers by setting the `type` attribute of the `<ol>` (ordered list) element to `I`, `i`, `A`, `a`, or `1`.

    [⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)

26. **What is the purpose of the `list-style-type` property in CSS?**  
   The `list-style-type` property in CSS is used to specify the appearance of the list item marker (bullet point or numbering) for unordered and ordered lists. It allows you to change the style of the marker to different types such as disc, circle, square, decimal, etc.

   [⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)

27. **How can you create a list that doesn't have any bullet points or numbering but is still structured as a list?**  
   You can create a list without bullet points or numbering by applying CSS styling to remove the default list styles. This can be achieved by setting the `list-style-type` property to `none`. The list items will still be structured as a list but won't have any visible markers.

28. **Can you nest different types of lists within each other?**  
   Yes, you can nest different types of lists within each other in HTML. For example, you can nest an unordered list (`<ul>`) inside an ordered list (`<ol>`) and vice versa. Additionally, you can also nest definition lists (`<dl>`) within ordered or unordered lists.

   [⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)

29. **How do you create a list where each item is a link?**  
   To create a list where each item is a link, you can simply wrap the `<a>` tag (anchor tag) around the content of each list item (`<li>`). This way, each list item will be clickable and act as a link to the specified URL.

   Example:
   ```html
   <ul>
     <li><a href="#">Link 1</a></li>
     <li><a href="#">Link 2</a></li>
     <li><a href="#">Link 3</a></li>
   </ul>
   ```

30. **How can you change the spacing between list items using CSS?**  
   You can change the spacing between list items using CSS by applying margin or padding properties to the list items (`<li>`). By adjusting the margin or padding values, you can control the spacing between individual list items, either horizontally or vertically.

   Example:
   ```html
      ul {
     list-style-type: none;
     padding: 0;
   }
   
   li {
     margin-bottom: 10px; /* Adjust the spacing between list items */
   }
   ```

31. **What are HTML list attributes?**  
   HTML lists can have attributes that define various properties such as type, start, and compactness. Some commonly used HTML list attributes include:
   - `type`: Specifies the type of list item marker (e.g., disc, circle, square for unordered lists; 1, A, a, I, i for ordered lists).
   - `start`: Specifies the starting value of an ordered list.
   - `compact`: Deprecated attribute used to specify whether the list should be displayed more compactly.

   Example:
   ```html
   <ul type="circle">
       <li>Item 1</li>
       <li>Item 2</li>
       <li>Item 3</li>
   </ul>
   <ol start="5">
       <li>Item 5</li>
       <li>Item 6</li>
       <li>Item 7</li>
   </ol>
   ```
